## About Me

Hey there!

I'm Yuvraj („ÉÑ), a coding enthusiast who loves learning new stuff. I started with making websites and now I'm exploring deeper into web development, going from browsers to server stuff.

Right now, I'm super interested in web3, which includes cool things like blockchain and smart contracts. I'm excited to keep up with all the new tech changes.

What makes me different is my drive to go beyond just basic bots. I'm all about improving my skills, especially in competitive programming, so I can solve tricky problems in creative ways.

And hey, speaking of bots, did you hear about the programmer who got stuck in the shower? He couldn't find the 'sudo' soap! üòÑ

Basically, I'm determined to become a versatile developer who can handle the challenges of today's tech world, come up with new ideas, and make a real impact in the industry.
